Q. Chef is shopping for masks. In the shop, he encounters 22 types of masks:
Disposable Masks — cost XX but last only 11 day.
Cloth Masks — cost YY but last 1010 days.
Chef wants to buy masks to last him 100100 days. He will buy the masks which cost him the least. In case there is a tie in terms of cost, Chef will be eco-friendly and choose the cloth masks. Which type of mask will Chef choose?

Ans.
Code:
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int a;
    cin>>a;
    int x,y;
    for(int i=0; i<a; i++)
    {
        cin>>x>>y;
        if(x*100>=y*10)
        {
            cout<<"Cloth"<<endl;
        }
        else
        {
            cout<<"Disposable"<<endl;
        }
    }
	return 0;
}
